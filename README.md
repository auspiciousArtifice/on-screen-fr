### How to Run
Go to application-files directory with two separate tabs/windows in your terminal. On one tab, run the command: `npx react-native start`. In the other tab, run the command: `npx react-native run ios/android` and pick whichever OS version you want between iOS and Android. Note: You will have to have a simulator configured to run either.
