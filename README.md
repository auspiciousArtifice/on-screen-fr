Front-end portion of the app

### Requirements
* Node
* Watchman
* iOS: 
  * CocoaPods
* Android: 
  * JDK 8 or newer
  * Android Studio

### How to Run
Go to application-files directory with two separate tabs/windows in your terminal. On one tab, run the command: `npx react-native start`. In the other tab, run the command: `npx react-native run ios/android` and pick whichever OS version you want between iOS and Android. Note: You will have to have a simulator configured to run either.

For iOS, you can open the project file (either OSFR.xcodeproj or OSFR.xcworkspace, if one doesn't work try the other) in XCode and build onto an iOS device. For Android, a simulator must be downloaded and configured in Android Studio.
